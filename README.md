Smart Plant Watering System (Using Arduino)
This System can keep track water level of the soil. We are using soil
moisture sensors that can sense the moisture content of the soil and sent the
output to the Arduino. The System has the facility of generating water
automatically. If the soil is dry that means plants need some water so the sensor
sends the signals to the Arduino. So, precisely the system provides a more
efficient and accurate result of maintaining water level of the soil.
